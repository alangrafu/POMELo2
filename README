# Introduction
POMELo2 is a PML (Proof Markup Language) Editor focused in three main goals:

- First, allow users to visualize provenance in a graphical way, that is also suitable to be shared with others.
- Second, allow users to modify existing PML documents using only their browsers. 
- Third, validate PML documents using PML Validation service.

POMELo2 is based on visualRDF[1] and it doesn't share any code with the original POMELo[2]. You can play with a demo 
available at [3].
